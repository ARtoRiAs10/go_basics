# Go Basics 

Welcome to my **Go Basics Practice** repository! 🚀 This repository contains my learning journey and exercises while practicing **Go (Golang)** as a beginner.

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository is created to document and track my progress as I learn **Go**, a powerful and efficient programming language developed by Google. It includes fundamental concepts, hands-on coding exercises, and small projects to reinforce learning.

## 🏆 Learning Objectives
- Understand Go syntax and structure
- Learn about variables, data types, and constants
- Explore functions and control flow (loops, conditionals)
- Work with arrays, slices, and maps
- Understand structs and interfaces
- Explore concurrency using Goroutines and Channels
- Practice error handling and logging
- Develop simple Go applications
